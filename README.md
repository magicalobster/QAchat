# QAchat
QA Chat is an AI quiz application platform based on Spring Boot, Redis, ChatGLM, RxJava, and SSE. Through this platform, users can quickly generate questions and create quiz applications using LLM. Once approved, it enables online quiz-taking and provides answer summaries based on various scoring algorithms or AI analysis. Additionally, administrators can centrally manage the entire siteâ€™s content and conduct statistical analysis.


The project is divided into three sections. 
1. An MBTI test that can be deployed as a WeChat mini-program, referencing [16personalities.vip](https://16personalities.vip/)
2. The backend service for QAchat.
